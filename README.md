## Scope and Limitations

### Scope
The cache simulator provided in this web application focuses specifically on the block-set-associative mapping with the replacement algorithm as Most Recently Used (MRU). This cache simulator can simulate two types of problems. One of which is sequential with varying loops while the other one is a simpleton. Both of these allow the user to input using either memory block or memory addresses for the sequence to be mapped onto the cache. For the cache size and memory size, users can also input in terms of blocks or words. Users are also given the option to save the output generated by the simulator via text file; however, the input would not be included anymore.

### Limitations
Limitation of the cache simulator includes having a permanent unit for the cache and memory access time. Moreover, the cache is assumed no load-through for computing for the miss penalty, total access time, and average access time.
