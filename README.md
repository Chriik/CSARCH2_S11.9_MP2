# CSARCH2_S11.9_MP2

## Scope and Limitations

### Scope
The cache simulator provided in this web application focuses specifically on the block-set-associative mapping with the replacement algorithm as Most Recently Used (MRU). This cache simulator can simulate two types of problems. One of which is sequential with varying loops while the other one is a simpleton. Both of these allow the user to input using either memory block or memory addresses for the sequence to be mapped onto the cache. For the cache size and memory size, users can also input in terms of blocks or words. Users are also given the option to save the output generated by the simulator via text file; however, the input would not be included anymore.

### Limitations
Limitation of the cache simulator includes having a permanent unit for the cache and memory access time. Moreover, the cache is assumed no load-through for computing for the miss penalty, total access time, and average access time. All values computed would not be rounded off to a specific number of decimal places.

## Getting Started (Deployed Website)

1. Open a browser and go to the link `TODO: change to deployed link`

2. The website is now running.

### Features

* User may view the user guide through clicking the **User guide** button on the top right corner. 

* User may go back to the home page where they are in the website through clicking the **CACHEME** on the upper left corner.

![TODO: INSERT PICTURE](INSERTLINK)

* User may simulate simpleton or sequential version by clicking on **try now** or **Simulate** dropdown and pick the choice they want.

#### Simpleton

* For simpleton, users are allowed to input a query sequence in terms of memory block or memory address. These has to be separted with spaces.

![TODO: INSERT PICTURE](INSERTLINK)

#### Sequential

* For sequential, users can add tasks/varying loops through clicking the **+** icon while delete tasks/varying loops through the **-** icon.

#### Simpleton & Sequential

* Both simpleton and sequential requires the input for the following:
|            Inputs             |
| ----------------------------- |
| Block size  (words)           |
| Set size (blocks)             |
| Cache size (blocks/words)     |
| Cache access time (ns)        |
| Memory size (blocks/words)    |
| Memory access time (ns)       |

* Upon filling up the inputs, the user may opt to erase everything by clicking the **Reset** button or simulate the cache through clicking the **Simulate** button

![TODO: INSERT PICTURE](INSERTLINK)

* After simulating, the following outputs will be shown:
|          Outputs          |
| ------------------------- |
| Snapshot of Cache Memory  |
| Number of Cache Miss      |
| Number of Cache Hit       |
| Total                     |
| Miss Penalty              |
| Average Access Time       |
| Total Access Time         |

![TODO: INSERT PICTURE](INSERTLINK)

* User may choose to store these outputs in a text file that will be downloaded once clicking the **Save as text file** button
