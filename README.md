## Scope and Limitations

### Scope
The cache simulator web application focuses specifically on the block-set-associative mapping with the replacement algorithm as Most Recently Used (MRU). This cache simulator can simulate two types of problems. One of which is sequential with varying loops, whereas the other one is a simpleton. Both problems require the block size, set size, cache size, cache access time, memory size, and memory access time as inputs. The user can input the cache size and memory size in terms of blocks or words. For the sequential problem, the user may input many tasks wherein each task contains the range of blocks or words to be accessed sequentially, and the number of times the task will be performed. The simpleton problem, on the other hand, requires a query sequence, either in terms of blocks or addresses, as input. The simulator also performs error-checking on all the inputs before simulating the problem. The block size, set size, cache size, and memory size should all be positive integers and a power of 2, while the memory access time and cache access time should both be positive real numbers. Moreover, the addresses or blocks in the query sequence input should all be integers and within the range of the blocks or addresses of the main memory. After validating the inputs, the problem is simulated and the output of the simulation is shown. The outputs shown are the cache misses, cache hits, total queries, miss penalty, average access time, total access time, and the snapshot of the cache memory after cache mapping. The user is also given an option to save the output generated by the simulator via text file; however, the input would not be included in the text file anymore.

### Limitations
Although the main memory read policy can be load-through or no load-through, the designed cache simulator only assumes no load-through in computing for the miss penalty, total access time, and average access time. Moreover, for simplicity purposes, the cache access time and memory access time are both fixed to nanoseconds as their unit of time. 

## Getting Started (Deployed Website)

1. Open a browser and go to the link `TODO: change to deployed link`
```
TODO: change to deployed link
```

2. The website is now running.

### Features

* User may view the user guide through clicking the **User guide** button on the top right corner or clicking the **See how it works**. 

* User may go back to the home page wherever they are in the website through clicking the **CACHEME** on the upper left corner.

![TODO: INSERT PICTURE](INSERTLINK)

* User may simulate simpleton or sequential version by clicking on **Try now** or **Simulate** dropdown and pick the choice they want.

#### Simpleton

* For simpleton, users are allowed to input a query sequence in terms of memory block or memory address. These has to be separted with spaces.

![TODO: INSERT PICTURE](INSERTLINK)

#### Sequential

* For sequential, users can add tasks/varying loops through clicking the **+** icon while delete tasks/varying loops through the **-** icon. 

![TODO: INSERT PICTURE](INSERTLINK)

#### Simpleton & Sequential

* Both simpleton and sequential require the input for the following:

|            Inputs             |
| :---------------------------: |
| Block size  (words)           |
| Set size (blocks)             |
| Cache size (blocks/words)     |
| Cache access time (ns)        |
| Memory size (blocks/words)    |
| Memory access time (ns)       |

* Upon filling up the inputs, the user may opt to erase everything by clicking the **Reset** button or simulate the cache through clicking the **Simulate** button

![TODO: INSERT PICTURE](INSERTLINK)

* After simulating, the following outputs will be shown:

|          Outputs          |
| :------------------------:|
| Snapshot of Cache Memory  |
| Number of Cache Miss      |
| Number of Cache Hit       |
| Total                     |
| Miss Penalty              |
| Average Access Time       |
| Total Access Time         |

![TODO: INSERT PICTURE](INSERTLINK)

* User may choose to store these outputs in a text file that will be downloaded once clicking the **Save as text file** button
